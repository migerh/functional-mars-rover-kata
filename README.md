# Mars Rover

This piece of code was written during a coding kata at
[JSCraftCamp 2018](http://jscraftcamp.org/).

Rules: <https://codurance.com/2017/10/12/functional-calisthenics/>
Task: <https://codurance.com/2017/11/16/katas-for-functional-calisthenics/#marsroverkata>

## Things still missing

* The set of instructions will be provided from the console
* Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given
  sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last
  possible point and reports the obstacle.
* If there was an obstacle, the mars rover will output the last position before
  the obstacle and a text saying an obstacle was found.
